\cf4 THE PRESIDENT: \'a0Hello, everybody. \'a0These are a lot of my friends, but you have been so helpful. \'a0And we did well. \'a0The election, it came out really well. \'a0Next time we\'92ll triple it up or quadruple it, right? \'a0We want to get over 51, right? \'a0At least 51. \'a0\
Well, this is Black History Month, so this is our little breakfast, our little get-together. \'a0Hi, Lynne, how are you? \'a0\
THE PRESIDENT: \'a0Nice to see you. \'a0And just a few notes. \'a0During this month, we honor the tremendous history of the African Americans throughout our country -- throughout the world, if you really think about it, right? \'a0And their story is one of unimaginable sacrifice, hard work and faith in America.\
I\'92ve gotten a real glimpse -- during the campaign, I\'92d go around with Ben to a lot of different places that I wasn\'92t so familiar with. \'a0They\'92re incredible people. \'a0And I want to thank Ben Carson, who\'92s going to be heading up HUD. \'a0It\'92s a big job, and it\'92s a job that\'92s not only housing, it\'92s mind and spirit, right, Ben? \'a0And you understand that. \'a0Nobody is going to be better than Ben.\
Last month, we celebrated the life of the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., whose incredible example is unique in American history. \'a0You read all about Dr. Martin Luther King a week ago when somebody said I took the statue out of my office, and it turned out that that was fake news. \'a0(Laughter.) \'a0It was fake news. \'a0The statue is cherished. \'a0It\'92s one of the favorite things in the -- and we have some good ones. \'a0We have Lincoln and we have Jefferson and we have Dr. Martin Luther King, and we have -- but they said the statue, the bust of Dr. Martin Luther King was taken out of the office. \'a0And it was never even touched. \'a0So I think it was a disgrace, but that\'92s the way the press is. \'a0Very unfortunate.\
I am very proud now that we have a museum on the National Mall where people can learn about Reverend King, so many other things. \'a0Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody who\'92s done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I notice -- Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, and millions more black Americans who made America what it is today. \'a0Big impact.\
I am proud to honor this heritage, and we\'92ll be honoring it more and more. \'a0The folks at the table in almost all cases have been great friends and supporters. \'a0And Darrell -- I met Darrell when he was defending me on television. \'a0(Laughter.) \'a0And the people that were on the other side of the argument didn\'92t have a chance, right? \'a0And Paris has done an amazing job in a very hostile CNN community. \'a0(Laughter.) \'a0He\'92s all by himself -- seven people and Paris. \'a0So I\'92ll take Paris over the seven. \'a0(Laughter.) \'a0But I don\'92t watch CNN so I don\'92t get to see you as much as I want to. \'a0(Laughter.) \'a0I don\'92t like watching fake news.\
THE PRESIDENT: \'a0But Fox has treated me very nice -- wherever Fox is, thank you. \'a0\
We\'92re going to need better schools, and we need them soon. \'a0We need more jobs, we need better wages -- a lot better wages. \'a0We\'92re going to work very hard on the inner city. \'a0Ben is going to be doing that big league. \'a0It\'92s one of his big things that we\'92re going to be looking at.\
We need safer communities, and we\'92re going to do that with law enforcement. \'a0We\'92re going to make it safe. \'a0We\'92re going to make it much better than it is right now. \'a0Right now it\'92s terrible, and I saw you talking about it the other night, Paris, on something else that was really -- you did a fantastic job the other night on a very unrelated show. \'a0I\'92m ready to do my part -- it\'92s the only time I can see him. \'a0I\'92m ready to do my part, and I will say this: \'a0We\'92re going to work together. \'a0\
This is a great group. \'a0This is a group that\'92s been so special to me. \'a0You really helped me a lot. \'a0If you remember, I wasn\'92t going to do well with the African American community, and after they heard me speaking and talking about the inner city and lots of other things, we ended up getting -- I won\'92t go into details, but we ended up getting substantially more than other candidates who had run in the past years. \'a0And now, we\'92re going to take that to new levels.\
I want to thank my television star over here. \'a0(Laughter.) \'a0Omarosa is actually a very nice person. \'a0Nobody knows that, but -- (laughter) -- I don\'92t want to destroy her reputation. \'a0She is a very good person and she\'92s been helpful right from the beginning of the campaign. \'a0And I appreciate it. \'a0I really do. \'a0Very special.\
And so I want to thank everybody for being here. \'a0Could we maybe just go around the room and we\'92ll introduce ourselves. \'a0And the press can stay for that, and I\'92m sure they have no questions about last night because it was such a good launch. \'a0We have a fantastic, hopefully, new justice of the Supreme Court. \'a0And hopefully, that will be -- he\'92ll be approved very, very quickly. \'a0He\'92s outstanding in every way -- academically. \'a0He\'92s done almost as well as you did, Darrell, in college. \'a0(Laughter.) \'a0Not quite, right? \'a0But he\'92s a great man and I think he\'92ll be a great, great justice. \'a0And he\'92s being very well-received. \'a0It was a big evening. \'a0Very big evening.\
So, Paris, why don\'92t we start with you? \'a0Go ahead.\
THE PRESIDENT: \'a0Well, I\'92m glad you\'92re in support of me because I\'92d be all -- I\'92d be in the wilderness without you guys. \'a0You are so effective. \'a0I appreciate it.\
THE PRESIDENT: \'a0Thank you.\
THE PRESIDENT: \'a0Thank you. \'a0Thank you.\
THE PRESIDENT: \'a0Oh, good. \'a0\
THE PRESIDENT: \'a0Lieutenant Colonel -- good job. \'a0\
THE PRESIDENT: \'a0You know, the one thing I didn't understand about Belinda -- I thought they were married maybe five or six years, because look how they look so young. \'a0(Laughter.) \'a0Should you say how many years you've been married?\
THE PRESIDENT: \'a0That's actually amazing. \'a0I wouldn't have known.\
THE PRESIDENT: \'a0Thank you. \'a0Thank you very much.\
THE PRESIDENT: \'a0That's a great idea because Chicago is totally out of control. \'a0\
THE PRESIDENT: \'a0If they're not going to solve the problem -- and what you're doing is the right thing -- then we're going to solve the problem for them because we're going to have to do something about Chicago. \'a0Because what's happening in Chicago should not be happening in this country.\
THE PRESIDENT: \'a0Good.\
THE PRESIDENT: \'a0I understand.\
PRESIDENT TRUMP: \'a0I love it.\
THE PRESIDENT: \'a0Thank you. \'a0And it is -- I mean, a lot of the media is actually the opposition party. \'a0They're so biased and really is a disgrace. \'a0Some of you are fantastic and fair, but so much of the media is opposition party and knowingly saying incorrect things. \'a0So it's a very sad situation. \'a0But we seem to be doing well. \'a0It's almost like, in the meantime, we won. \'a0So maybe they don't have the influence they think, but they really are -- they really have to straighten out their act. \'a0They're very dishonest people.\
James.\
THE PRESIDENT: \'a0Thank you. \'a0You've been great. \'a0Thank you, James.\
And, Lynne.\
THE PRESIDENT: \'a0Oh, that's great. \'a0You've got a good person. \'a0\
THE PRESIDENT: \'a0That's great. \'a0You did a fantastic job.\
THE PRESIDENT: \'a0Thank you.\
THE PRESIDENT: \'a0Fantastic. \'a0Thank you. \'a0Thank you very much.\
THE PRESIDENT: \'a0We did well in West Virginia. \'a0(Laughter.)\
THE PRESIDENT: \'a0And we love the coal miners. \'a0We're going to put them back to work.\
THE PRESIDENT: \'a0Oh, really? \'a0Great job.\
PRESIDENT TRUMP: \'a0Okay, well, that's nice.\
THE PRESIDENT: \'a0Fantastic.\
THE PRESIDENT: \'a0Howard graduate. \'a0That's good stuff. \'a0Thank you, everybody. \'a0Thank you.\
