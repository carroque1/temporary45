THE PRESIDENT: \'a0Thank you. \'a0Thank you, everybody. \'a0Thank you very much. \'a0\
Millions of American families -- and I mean millions -- continue to suffer from Obamacare while congressional Democrats obstruct our efforts to rescue them. \'a0And I'll tell you, that's exactly what\'92s happening. \'a0The Democrats have let you down, big league. \'a0Standing beside me are two such families, representing so many others -- millions of people -- who have been victimized by Obamacare -- terrible law.\'a0\
My thanks to Michael and Tammy Kushman from Marinette County, and Robert and Sarah Stoll from Kenosha, as well as their wonderful families, for joining us today. \'a0We appreciate it. \'a0We appreciate all the people being here. \'a0Thank you, folks. \'a0(Applause.) \'a0They love their country, play by the rules, and work hard to give their loved ones the best life possible.\
Michael Kushman is a proud veteran of the United States Army Medical Service Core. \'a0He and his wife Tammy were forced onto the Obamacare exchange in 2015 -- and like countless others, they were shocked to learn that they couldn\'92t keep their doctor as promised. \'a0 They couldn't keep their plan as promised. \'a0They started out paying $600 per month. \'a0Then their insurer quit the exchange, so they had to switch to a new plan, and it went up to $1,000 a month. \'a0And it keeps going up and up and up. \'a0And that's where we are today. \'a0Now it's over $1,400 per month. \'a0They\'92ve been forced off their plans and onto a new one three times in three years. \'a0Their premiums have soared 127 percent. \'a0The Kushmans now spend nearly one-fourth of their net monthly income on health insurance. \'a0So -- both of you, both families. \'a0Both great families. \'a0\
Robert and his wife Sarah Stoll have also endured enormous pain under the crushing burden of Obamacare. \'a0Robert serves as a volunteer captain for the Randall Fire Department. \'a0He was a small business owner for 30 years. \'a0But their Obamacare premiums doubled, and Sarah was forced to leave retirement and find a part-time job just to pay the bills. \'a0When she did so, making matters worse, their new income meant they were no longer eligible for the tax credit they had once received -- and the federal government actually forced them to repay thousands of dollars.\
These are sad -- I agree, that's true. \'a0Has it happened to you also? \'a0Yes. \'a0Yeah, it has. \'a0These are sad but familiar stories in Wisconsin, where Obamacare premiums have doubled. \'a0Obamacare is one of the greatest catastrophes that our country has signed into law -- and the victims are innocent, hardworking Americans like Michael and Tammy, Robert and Sarah. \'a0These citizens deserve so much better.\'a0\
The House of Representatives has passed on to the Senate, and the Senate is getting ready to do something -- hopefully it will get done -- where we will come up with a solution, and a really good one, to healthcare. \'a0No matter how good it is, we will get no obstructionist Democrat votes. \'a0No matter how good it is -- if it's the greatest healthcare plan ever devised, we will get zero votes by the obstructionists, the Democrats. \'a0It's time to give American families quality, reliable, affordable healthcare -- and that\'92s what we are working very hard to do. \'a0And we'll get it done.\
So I want to thank you, I want to thank the families -- thank you very much -- for being here. \'a0And I love being in Wisconsin. \'a0I love being in Wisconsin. \'a0Thank you. \'a0(Applause.) \'a0\uc0\u8232 \'a0 \'a0 \'a0 \'a0 \'a0 \'a0 \'a0 \'a0 \'a0 \'a0 \'a0 \'a0 \'a0\u8232 END \'a0 \'a0 \'a0 \'a0 \'a0 \'a0 \'a0\u8232 3:19 P.M. CDT\
